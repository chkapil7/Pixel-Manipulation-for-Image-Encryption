# Pixel-Manipulation-for-Image-Encryption
Exciting new project alert! Introducing my GitHub repo for pixel manipulation-based image encryption. Using Python, I've crafted a powerful tool that harnesses the magic of pixel manipulation to encrypt and decrypt images securely. Dive into the code, explore the possibilities, and join me in revolutionizing image security!

**Important :**
To run the code your teriminal must PIL
If PIL is not present in your terimial install using this code : pip install pillow
